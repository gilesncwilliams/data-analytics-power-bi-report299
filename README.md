With operations spanning across United Kingdom, Germany and the USA, the business has accumulated large amounts of sales from disparate sources over the years, dating back to 2010. The majority of their stores are bricks and mortar retail stores, with a small amount of online sales through their web portal.

The goal of the project is to use Microsoft Power BI to design a comprehensive Quarterly report, focusing on performance of their products and stores, and highlighting their best customers. The project tasks will involve extracting and transforming data from various origins, designing a robust data model rooted in a star-based schema, and constructing a multi-page report to provide actionable insights to help better decision making.

The report will include:

- An Executive Summary page: to give an overview of company performance and check KPIs.
- A Customer Detail page: to show analysis of customer data and highlight high values customers.
- A Product Detail page: to provide an in-depth look at which products are performing well, with the ability to drill down into more detail about the product categories and performance by region.
- A Stores Map: for regional managers to track stores' quarterly profit and revenue targets.

Following completion of the report, the business has also asked for five SQL queries to be written in order to extract further insights from the data, and share these with a broader audience who do not have access to Power BI.


## Installation Instructions

To view the report, Microsoft Power BI is required. Power BI Desktop can be downloaded for free from Microsoft's website to view and edit the report.

However a license for Power BI Service is requried to publish and share reports amongst other Power BI users.

Please note if using a Mac or Linux operating system you will need to run Windows on a virtual machine through a platform like Azure or Oracle.
